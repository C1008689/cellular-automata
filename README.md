- ## Project Description
This project is a forest simulation implemented as a cellular automaton. Cellular automata are computational models that consist of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of a finite number of states. The state of each cell in the grid changes over time according to a set of rules that depend on the states of neighboring cells


- ## notes

"The most important weather factors that affect forest spresading is the tmperature and the wind speed and direction"

"The wind speed and direction greatly affect the forest fire spreading anfd every model forest fire spreading should incorperate this important factor"(Karafyllidis,1997) 
I will try impliment wind to the code as it will make the the simulation more realstic and will beavour like a how a real life forrest fire would be like. 
A way i could do this is by the compass arranged by the corrsponding cell blocks. For exampls i will mkae the wind thats goes north, affect the north cell, which will  be the top cell. 





4.3 effect of topography 
"Almost none of the forestrs in this planet is flat." (Karafyllidis,1997) this will justifiey why I model my simulation is such a way. Giving context to why its structure in that way.
